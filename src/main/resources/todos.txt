// TODO check composite key from two columns in this entity (Type entity)
// TODO think about photo url in entity and photo bytes in dtos - is this a good approach?
// TODO how to map: photos (bytes to url), business hours(string to localtime) and how to enrich many to one enitities with spot data?
// TODO if we are adding a review to spot, should mobile/UI send json with the whole spot(not necessary) or just spot_id and review data?
// TODO decide what to do with TAGS, how to store them? (many to many, string in dto -> list<string> after mapping to entity?)
// TODO tests for adding ratings
// TODO convert json to LocalDate via annotations
